    "projectSummary": "The project includes functionality for downloading Maven Wrapper Jar from a specific URL using different methods such as utilizing MVNW_USERNAME and MVNW_PASSWORD for authentication and saving the downloaded file in a specified directory. It also contains a controller class, the ActorController, which allows for interaction with an actor database via specific HTTP routes. These routes include retrieving an actor list, retrieving details of a specific actor by ID, as well as search capabilities through first and last names.",

    "projectCodeComplexity": "Moderate",
    "projectImprovementScopes": "The project can be improved by breaking large methods into smaller ones for better readability and testability. It could benefit from more detailed error messages as well as specific and better exception handling. Some functionalities can be offloaded or reused to reduce code complexity. In the case of ActorController, conditional logic can be offloaded to a service layer and exception handling for not found scenarios can be added. The use of Data Transfer Objects(DTOs) could also be considered to avoid directly returning entities."
